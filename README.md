# VAE Model

## Introduction

This project implements a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** for data generation using latent space representation. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and runs on **Google Colab** for easy execution.

## About Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a type of generative model that learns to encode input data into a latent space and then reconstructs it. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs introduce a probabilistic approach to latent space representation, making them effective for generating new data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Encoder**: Maps input data to a probability distribution in the latent space.
- **Latent Space**: A lower-dimensional representation from which data can be sampled.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs data from the latent representation.
- **Reparameterization Trick**: Ensures differentiability during training by expressing stochastic variables in a differentiable way.
- **Loss Function**: Combines **Reconstruction Loss** (to minimize reconstruction error) and **KL Divergence** (to ensure smoothness in latent space distribution).

## Features
- **Train a VAE model** on image datasets.
- **Generate new data** by sampling from the latent space.
- **Visualize results** to assess the model's reconstruction quality.

## How to Use
1. **Open Google Colab**
2. **Upload the notebook** or run it directly from the repository.
3. **Execute all cells** in order to:
   - Install required dependencies.
   - Download the dataset and prepare it for training.
   - Train the model and visualize results.

## Results
The model will generate images from the latent space and reconstruct input images, demonstrating VAE's ability to learn representations and generate new data.
